Location: .claude/hooks/memory_posttool.py
Summary: PostToolUse hook that reminds agent to consider saving memory after edits.
Used by: Claude Code settings.json PostToolUse hook (Edit, Write tools)

PHILOSOPHY: Bias toward saving memories. Since pact-memory-agent runs in
background, there's no workflow interruption cost. Better to save too much
than lose context.

Always fires after Edit/Write to provide contextual guidance. The agent
decides based on whether they've completed a unit of work or are mid-task.

Input: JSON from stdin with tool_name, tool_input, tool_output
Output: JSON with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` on every edit
