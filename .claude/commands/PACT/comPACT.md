description: Delegate a focused task within a single domain (light ceremony)
argument-hint: [backend|frontend|database|prepare|test|architect] <task>
---
Delegate this focused task within a single PACT domain: $ARGUMENTS

For independent sub-tasks, you may invoke MULTIPLE specialists of the same type in parallel.

---

## Specialist Selection

| Shorthand | Specialist | Use For |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| `backend` | pact-backend-coder | Server-side logic, APIs, middleware |
| `frontend` | pact-frontend-coder | UI, React, client-side |
| `database` | pact-database-engineer | Schema, queries, migrations |
| `prepare` | pact-preparer | Research, requirements gathering |
| `test` | pact-test-engineer | Standalone test tasks |
| `architect` | pact-architect | Design guidance, pattern selection |

### If specialist not specified or unrecognized

If the first word isn't a recognized shorthand, treat the entire argument as the task and apply smart selection below.

**Auto-select when clear**:
- Task contains domain-specific keywords:
  - Frontend: React, Vue, UI, CSS, component
  - Backend: Express, API, endpoint, middleware, server
  - Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL, schema, migration, index
  - Test: Jest, test, spec, coverage
  - Prepare: research, investigate, requirements, explore, compare
  - Architect: pattern, singleton, factory, structure, architecture
- Task mentions specific file types (.tsx, .jsx, .sql, .spec.ts, etc.)
- Proceed immediately: "Delegating to [specialist]..."

**Ask when ambiguous**:
- Generic verbs without domain context (fix, improve, update)
- Feature-level scope that spans domains (login, user profile, dashboard)
- Performance/optimization without specific layer
- → Use `AskUserQuestion` tool:
  - Question: "Which specialist should handle this task?"
  - Options: List the 2-3 most likely specialists based on context (e.g., "Backend" / "Frontend" / "Database")

---

## When to Parallelize (Same-Domain)

If the task contains multiple independent items within the same domain, invoke multiple specialists in parallel:

**Parallelize when:**
- Multiple independent items (bugs, components, endpoints)
- No shared files between sub-tasks
- Same patterns/conventions apply to all

**Examples:**
| Task | Agents Invoked |
|------|----------------|
| "Fix 3 backend bugs" | 3 backend-coders (parallel) |
| "Add validation to 5 endpoints" | Multiple backend-coders |
| "Update styling on 3 components" | Multiple frontend-coders |

**Do NOT parallelize when:**
- Sub-tasks modify the same files
- Sub-tasks have dependencies on each other
- Conventions haven't been established yet (run one first, then parallelize)

---

## S2 Light Coordination (Required Before Parallel Invocation)

Before invoking multiple specialists in parallel, perform this coordination check:

1. **Identify potential conflicts**
   - List files each sub-task will touch
   - Flag any overlapping files

2. **Resolve conflicts (if any)**
   - **Same file**: Sequence those sub-tasks OR assign clear section boundaries
   - **Style/convention**: First agent's choice becomes standard

3. **Set boundaries**
   - Clearly state which sub-task handles which files/components
   - Include this in each specialist's prompt

**If conflicts cannot be resolved**: Sequence the work instead of parallelizing.

---

## Invocation

**Create feature branch** if not already on one (recommended for behavior changes; optional for trivial).

### Single Specialist (Default)

**Invoke the specialist with**:
```
comPACT mode: Work directly from this task description.
Check docs/plans/, docs/preparation/, docs/architecture/ briefly if they exist—reference relevant context.
Do not create new documentation artifacts in docs/.
Focus on the task at hand.
Testing responsibilities:
- New unit tests: Required for logic changes; optional for trivial changes (documentation, comments, config).
- Existing tests: If your changes break existing tests, fix them.
- Before handoff: Run the test suite and ensure all tests pass.

If you hit a blocker, STOP and report it so the orchestrator can run /PACT:imPACT.

Task: [user's task description]
```

### Parallel Specialists (Same-Domain)

When invoking multiple specialists in parallel, add boundary context to each:

```
comPACT mode (parallel): You are one of [N] specialists working in parallel.

YOUR SCOPE: [specific sub-task and files this agent owns]
OTHER AGENTS' SCOPE: [what other agents are handling - do not touch]

Work directly from this task description.
Check docs/plans/, docs/preparation/, docs/architecture/ briefly if they exist—reference relevant context.
Do not create new documentation artifacts in docs/.
Stay within your assigned scope—do not modify files outside your boundary.

Testing responsibilities:
- New unit tests: Required for logic changes.
- Existing tests: If your changes break existing tests, fix them.
- Before handoff: Run the test suite for your scope.

If you hit a blocker or need to modify files outside your scope, STOP and report it.

Task: [this agent's specific sub-task]
```

**After all parallel agents complete**: Verify no conflicts occurred, run full test suite.

---

## After Specialist Completes

- Receive handoff from specialist
- Report completion to user

**Next steps** (user decides):
- Trivial changes → commit directly
- Behavior changes → consider `/PACT:peer-review` for review and PR

**If blocker reported**:

Examples of blockers:
- Task requires a different specialist's domain
- Missing dependencies, access, or information
- Same error persists after multiple fix attempts
- Scope exceeds single-domain capability (needs cross-domain coordination)
- Parallel agents have unresolvable conflicts

When blocker is reported:
1. Receive blocker report from specialist
2. Run `/PACT:imPACT` to triage
3. May escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` if task exceeds single-domain scope

---

## When to Escalate

Recommend `/PACT:orchestrate` instead if:
- Task spans multiple specialist domains
- Complex cross-domain coordination needed
- Architectural decisions affect multiple components
- Full preparation/architecture documentation is needed

### Variety-Aware Escalation

During comPACT execution, if you discover the task is more complex than expected:

| Discovery | Variety Signal | Action |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Task spans multiple domains | Medium+ (7+) | Escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` |
| Significant ambiguity/uncertainty | High (11+) | Escalate; may need PREPARE phase |
| Architectural decisions required | High (11+) | Escalate; need ARCHITECT phase |
| Higher risk than expected | High (11+) | Consider `/PACT:plan-mode` first |

**Heuristic**: If re-assessing variety would now score Medium+ (7+), escalate.

**Conversely**, if the specialist reports the task is simpler than expected:
- Note in handoff to orchestrator
- Complete the task; orchestrator may simplify remaining work
