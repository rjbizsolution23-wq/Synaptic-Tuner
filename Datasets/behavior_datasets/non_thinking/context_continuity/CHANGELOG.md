# Context Continuity Dataset Changelog

## Version 1.1 - 2025-11-22

**Added 30 new examples demonstrating response patterns AFTER tool results**

Total examples: 130 (100 original + 30 new)

### New Example Distribution

#### Pattern 1: Text-Only Response (10 examples)
Examples showing rich, detailed text responses after receiving tool results. Demonstrates:
- Comprehensive summaries referencing specific data from results
- Workflow completion explanations with concrete numbers
- Strategic explanations of next steps based on results

Example scenarios:
- Folder creation → Detailed organization summary (lines 101-102)
- Batch search → Meeting themes analysis with counts (lines 103-104)
- Test results → Quality metrics summary with percentages (lines 105-106)
- Workspace load → Budget system explanation with context (lines 107-108)
- ExecutePrompt → Methodology recommendation explanation (lines 109-110)

#### Pattern 2: Tool-Only Response (10 examples)
Examples showing seamless workflow continuation with tool calls. Demonstrates:
- Rich sessionMemory referencing previous action results
- Clear workflow progression in toolContext
- Specific progress tracking (e.g., "file 2 of 8")

Example scenarios:
- File move completion → Continue moving remaining files (lines 111-112)
- Search results → Begin systematic updates (lines 113-114)
- Folder creation → Read schema for backup (lines 115-116)
- Directory listing → Recover identified files (lines 117-118)
- Template reading → Create customized content (lines 119-120)

#### Pattern 3: Tool+Text Hybrid Response (10 examples)
Examples mixing tool calls with explanatory text. Demonstrates:
- Text responses that reference tool results AND explain next steps
- Tool calls that include narration of workflow checkpoints
- Balanced approach for complex multi-step workflows

Example scenarios:
- Search results → Detailed analysis with actionable summary (lines 121-122)
- Batch search → Distribution analysis with insights (lines 123-124)
- Workspace load → Context explanation with planning guidance (lines 125-126)
- ExecutePrompt → Strategy documentation as next step (lines 127-128)
- Config update → Documentation sync with explanation (lines 129-130)

### Key Features of New Examples

**[Previous: ...] Notation:**
- All user messages use `[Previous: tool_name returned ...]` format
- Simulates post-tool-result scenarios
- Shows specific result details (e.g., file counts, success confirmations)

**Context Continuity Patterns:**
- sessionMemory: 80-150 chars, references BOTH previous action AND current result
- toolContext: 60-120 chars, shows workflow progression and reasoning
- Goals: Clear decomposition showing progress in multi-step workflows

**Good vs Bad Examples:**
- Each scenario has label=true (rich context) and label=false (sparse context) pair
- Demonstrates proper vs improper context continuity
- 15 good examples, 15 bad examples (30 total)

### Validation

✓ All examples use proper JSONL format
✓ All include required fields: conversations, label, behavior
✓ All context objects have 7 required fields
✓ sessionMemory never empty
✓ Alternating good/bad pattern maintained
✓ Total line count verified: 130 lines

### Use Cases

These examples train models to:
1. Recognize when to respond with text only (task complete, needs confirmation)
2. Recognize when to continue with tool calls (clear workflow sequence)
3. Balance tool calls with explanatory text (complex workflows, checkpoints)
4. Maintain rich context that references specific results from previous actions
5. Demonstrate workflow awareness and progress tracking
