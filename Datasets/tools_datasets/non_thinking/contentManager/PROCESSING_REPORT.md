## System Prompt Format

Each system prompt includes:

### For Default Workspace (448 examples)
```xml
<session_context>
IMPORTANT: When using tools, include these values in your tool call parameters:

- sessionId: "{sessionId}"
- workspaceId: "default" (no specific workspace selected)

Include these in the "context" parameter of your tool calls.
NOTE: Use "default" as the workspaceId when no specific workspace context is needed.
</session_context>
```

### For Specific Workspace (745 examples)
```xml
<session_context>
IMPORTANT: When using tools, include these values in your tool call parameters:

- sessionId: "{sessionId}"
- workspaceId: "{workspaceId}" (current workspace)

Include these in the "context" parameter of your tool calls.
</session_context>
<available_workspaces>
The following workspaces are available in this vault:

- {workspace_name} (id: "{workspace_id}")
  Description: {description}
  Root folder: {root_folder}

Use memoryManager with loadWorkspace mode to get full workspace context.
</available_workspaces>
```

---

## Workspace Name Generation

Workspace names were inferred from context clues using the keyword mapping table in CONTEXT_INJECTION_SPEC.md:

**Sources analyzed:**
- `sessionDescription`
- `primaryGoal`
- `sessionMemory`
- `toolContext`
- User message content

**Keyword matching:**
- Keywords extracted from all text sources
- Matched against predefined workspace types
- Defaults to "Personal Notes" if no match found

**Example inferences:**
- "budget", "expense" → Budget Tracker
- "podcast", "episode" → Podcast Production
- "project", "sprint" → Project Management
- "meeting", "agenda" → Meeting Notes
- "blog", "content" → Content Hub

## Example Transformation

### Before (tools_v1.0.jsonl)
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Read user-feedback.md."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": null,
      "tool_calls": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### After (tools_v1.1.jsonl)
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "<session_context>...</session_context>\n<available_workspaces>...</available_workspaces>"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Read user-feedback.md."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": null,
      "tool_calls": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key changes:**
1. System message added as first conversation item
2. `<session_context>` section with sessionId and workspaceId
3. `<available_workspaces>` section with inferred workspace details (for non-default)
4. All IDs match between system prompt and tool call arguments

---

## Validation Rules Applied

1. ✓ System prompt exists as first message (role: "system")
2. ✓ Session ID in tool call matches ID in `<session_context>`
3. ✓ Workspace ID in tool call matches ID in system prompt
4. ✓ All required fields present in system prompt
5. ✓ Proper XML-style section tags used

---

## Known Issues

### Line 470: Missing Context IDs
- **Issue:** Context object missing `sessionId` and `workspaceId`
- **Action:** Example left unchanged (no system prompt added)
- **Reason:** Cannot create proper system prompt without IDs
- **Impact:** 1 out of 1,194 examples (0.08%)

**Example context (line 470):**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "sessionMemory": "Maintaining vault content...",
    "toolContext": "Replacing content for accuracy..."
  }
}
```

**Expected format:**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "sessionId": "session_...",
    "workspaceId": "ws_...",
    "sessionMemory": "...",
    "toolContext": "...",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Processing Scripts

### process_v1.1.py
- Main processing script that transforms v1.0 to v1.1
- Implements workspace name inference algorithm
- Builds system prompts according to spec
- Handles both default and specific workspaces
- Error handling for malformed examples

### validate_v1.1.py
- Validates processed dataset against CONTEXT_INJECTION_SPEC.md
- Checks for system message presence
- Verifies ID matching between system prompt and tool calls
- Provides detailed statistics and error reporting

---

## Quality Assurance

### ID Matching Test
- **Checked:** 1,193 examples
- **Mismatches found:** 0
- **Accuracy:** 100%

### Sample Verification
Randomly sampled and manually verified:
- System prompts are well-formed
- IDs are correctly extracted and inserted
- Workspace names are contextually appropriate
- XML sections are properly formatted

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix line 470:** Add missing `sessionId` and `workspaceId` to context object
2. **Re-run processing:** After fixing, re-process to add system prompt to line 470
3. **Quality check:** Verify that all 1,194 examples have system prompts

---

## Success Criteria

- ✓ System prompts added to 99.92% of examples
- ✓ All IDs match between system prompts and tool calls (100% accuracy)
- ✓ Workspace names contextually appropriate
- ✓ Both default and specific workspaces handled correctly
- ✓ No data loss or corruption
- ✓ Output file structure preserved

---

## Conclusion

**Status: ✓ SUCCESS**

The contentManager dataset has been successfully processed to add system prompts according to the CONTEXT_INJECTION_SPEC.md. All validation checks passed with 99.92% success rate. The one skipped example (line 470) is due to missing required context IDs in the source data, not a processing error.

The processed dataset (tools_v1.1.jsonl) is ready for training and includes proper system context that will teach models to use provided IDs rather than hallucinating new ones.
